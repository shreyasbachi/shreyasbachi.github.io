# Research & Projects

## Research

<div class="card">
    <h3>Model Compression for Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
    <p>
        Investigating quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques to deploy deep learning models on low-power devices like the Duckiebot DB21 and NVIDIA Jetson. The goal is to optimize models for real-time object detection, lane detection, and depth estimation to enhance autonomous driving systems.
    </p>
