## Research

### Model Compression for Autonomous Vehicles
- Investigating **quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation** techniques to deploy **deep learning models** on **low-power devices** (e.g., **Duckiebot DB21, NVIDIA Jetson**).
- Optimizing models for **real-time object detection, lane detection, and depth estimation** to enhance **autonomous driving systems**.

---

### Reinforcement Learning & Dataset Distillation
- Implementing **dataset distillation** to create **synthetic datasets** that preserve key statistical properties of original datasets.
- Exploring reinforcement learning techniques to **optimize AI training efficiency**.
---

## Projects

### [U-Plan - HackHarvard 2024 Sustainability Winner](https://devpost.com/software/u-plan)
A geospatial analytics platform designed to **mitigate urban heat islands (UHI)** by leveraging **AI-driven insights**.

- Developed **interactive GIS heat maps** to analyze heat distribution in urban environments.
- Provided **data-driven recommendations** for sustainable urban planning.
- Integrated AI-powered **urban policy insights** for architects and policymakers.

### [Feal? - AI-Generated vs. Real Image Detector](https://github.com/shreyasbachi/feal)
A **computer vision model** for distinguishing **real vs. AI-generated images**.

- Fine-tuned **ResNet-18** with **data augmentation** for robust classification.
- Trained on a dataset containing **20% AI-generated images** from a custom **DCGAN**.
- Aims to address **misinformation and deepfake detection**.
