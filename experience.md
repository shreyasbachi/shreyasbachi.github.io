## Industry Experience

<div class="card">
    <h3>AI/ML Intern</h3>
    <span class="meta">Netradyne | May 2024 – July 2024</span>
    <p>
        At Netradyne, I worked on computer vision systems for commercial vehicle safety, specifically developing depth estimation models that predict time-to-collision with forward vehicles. The challenge was processing massive amounts of dashcam footage efficiently while maintaining high accuracy for safety-critical applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        I built an automated pipeline that processed over 30,000 videos from AWS S3, benchmarking state-of-the-art depth estimation architectures and optimizing them for real-time performance. Through systematic hyperparameter tuning and batch processing optimizations, I significantly improved both inference speed and prediction accuracy. The depth maps we generated are now being used to train adapted YOLO models for direct depth prediction.

    <h3>Software Engineer Intern</h3>
    <span class="meta">Clocr Inc. | June 2023 – July 2023</span>
    <p>
        I integrated GPT models into My-Legacy.ai, an estate planning chatbot where accuracy and reliability are critical—hallucinations aren't just inconvenient, they can lead to serious legal issues. The key was implementing retrieval-augmented generation with custom legal knowledge bases and careful fine-tuning to ground the model's responses in verified information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond the technical integration, I designed and ran A/B tests to measure the impact of different prompting strategies and knowledge base configurations on user satisfaction. The iterative testing process gave us confidence that the chatbot was providing more reliable and personalized recommendations to users navigating complex estate planning decisions.

## Leadership

<div class="card">
    <h3>Founding Co-President</h3>
    <span class="meta">CS+Social Good at ASU | 2023 – Present</span>
    <p>
        I co-founded CS+Social Good to create a space where students interested in ethical AI and technology for social impact could learn, collaborate, and build together. We organize workshops on topics like algorithmic bias, fairness in machine learning, and responsible AI development—bridging the gap between technical skills and their societal implications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond workshops, I mentor students who want to transition from theoretical knowledge to real-world applications, helping them navigate the messy intersection of AI capabilities, ethical constraints, and practical impact. It's rewarding to see students develop both technical competence and thoughtfulness about how their work affects people.

<div class="card">
    <h3>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h3>
    <span class="meta">Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in Java | ASU</span>
    <p>
        As a TA for advanced Java programming, I help students master design patterns, software architecture, and object-oriented principles that form the foundation of robust software systems. I hold office hours, conduct code reviews, and work with students one-on-one to debug tricky conceptual issues that emerge when building larger, more complex systems.
