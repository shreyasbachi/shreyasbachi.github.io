## About Me

I am an undergraduate researcher at Arizona State University studying machine learning, model compression, and sustainable urban computing. My recent projects involve generative AI for transportation planning, reinforcement learning dataset distillation, and energy-efficient inference for large models. I am broadly interested in developing efficient, reliable machine learning systems for real-world smart city applications.

My research explores practical challenges in deploying AI at scale. This includes compressing reinforcement learning training runs into compact synthetic datasets, profiling energy bottlenecks in Mixture-of-Experts models, and optimizing neural networks for edge devices. Through the Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative and my work at the Data Mining and Reinforcement Learning Lab, I investigate how to bridge the gap between state-of-the-art models and resource-constrained deployment environments.

Beyond research, I co-founded CS+Social Good at ASU to build a community to build tech projects that empower NGOs in need of technical tools. Outside of academia, I'm an avid football (soccer :P) fan and music producer! I believe technical excellence and thoughtful consideration of AI's societal impact should go hand in hand.
